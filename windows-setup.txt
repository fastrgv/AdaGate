Tar file extraction on Windows:

If you have a previous installation of the game on your computer, 
then delete it by typing something like:

	RMDIR/S <game-installation-directory>\<game-dir>

from a command line terminal.

This will save space on your computer's disk drive, and will 
help to avoid confusion.


Next, move the newest archive, a zip/gz/7z file 
[from your Downloads directory] to any directory of your choosing:
move <file-name>.extension <game-installation-directory>
cd <game-installation-directory>

Next, extract the tarball:

A) If you have it, PeaZip seems to work fine for all archive types.

B) If you do not already have an unzip utility, I recommend 
downloading 7z [from www.7-zip.org].  It's free, and works nicely:
1) 7z x <file-name>.7z [this unzips contents to a new game-dir]
2) cd <game-dir>
