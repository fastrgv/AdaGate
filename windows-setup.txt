Setup on Windows:

If you have a previous installation of the game on your computer, 
then delete it by typing something like:

	RMDIR/S <game-installation-directory>

from a command line terminal.

This will save space on your computer's disk drive, and will 
help to avoid confusion.

Next, unzip the newest archive to any directory of your choosing.  
If you do not already have an unzip utility, I recommend 
downloading 7z [from www.7-zip.org].  It's free, and works nicely:
1) 7z <file-name>.tar.gz [this unzips a tar file]
2) 7z <file-name>.tar    [this creates a new install directory]
3) cd <new-dir-name>
