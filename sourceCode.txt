Where is the Ada source code?

This repository exists for the convenience of gamers, not co-developers.  
The archive *.7z, contains all the source code, 
as well as the runtime files for 3 platforms, headers, shaders, textures, 
music, game files, compilation scripts, nonstandard external libraries, 
and executables, including a Mac-bundle.  Source code can be found in
./src/ and the ./adabindings/ & ./adautils/ sub-directories.

Type "7z x filename.7z" to extract the archive.

GitHub users: please ignore the "Source code" zip & tar.gz files. (They are auto-generated by GitHub into the release).
